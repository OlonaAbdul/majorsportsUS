##In this project, I read in a file of metropolitan regions and associated sports teams from wikipedia_data.html and answered some questions about each metropolitan region. Each of these regions have one or more teams from the "Big 4": NFL (football, in assets/nfl.csv), MLB (baseball, in assets/mlb.csv), NBA (basketball, in assets/nba.csv or NHL (hockey, in assets/nhl.csv). Please keep in mind that all codes are from the perspective of the metropolitan region, and that this file is the "source of authority" for the location of a given sports team. Thus teams which are commonly known by a different area (e.g. "Oakland Raiders") were mapped into the metropolitan region given (e.g. San Francisco Bay Area). This required some human data understanding outside of the data I have been given (e.g. I had to hand-code some names)
For each sport I answered the question: what is the win/loss ratio's correlation with the population of the city it is in? Win/Loss ratio refers to the number of wins over the number of wins plus the number of losses. I also calculated the correlation with pearsonr, so I sent in two ordered lists of values, the populations from the wikipedia_data.html file and the win/loss ratio for a given sport in the same order.I Averaged the win/loss ratios for those cities which have multiple teams of a single sport. . NB: I only used data from year 2018 for your analyses.
